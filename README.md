# Conway's Game of Life

- No libraries
- No tests

Just coding for a bit of fun.

Somewhere in here there is a talk on JavaScript performance. The plan being to write a nice readable version of Conways which generally has a lower frame rate. Then slowly iterate commit by commit into a really quick but non-readable version.

Hope to fnd the time for it some day!

## TODO
